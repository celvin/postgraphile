This is to make easy to bring up a Docker and traefik implementation for postgraphile, it will pull latest version every time is built and includes connection filter and cors setup, with the time I'll add jwt and more nice stuff provided by postgraphile.


Setup using: .env file


```bash
$ docker-compose up --build
```
